ID-0031	 a fun adventure. Perfect facilities available while there. I also enjoy stunning views. Beautiful views to shoulder the sunset. Will recommended to friend to go their when the were a holiday timr to enjoy every moment there             
ID-5462	 As an extended family  we went for a two night retreat at Resorts World tourist hotel over the Christmas weekend and stayed at tourist for the first night. It was very spacious and clean.
ID-8436	 Booked this hotel for the 3rd time in 4 years and it doesnt disappoint. The rooms are spacious and clean  and facilities are good. It is centrally located in tourist hotel so its very accessible. Will definitely return again.            
ID-5364	 Came here for short break. The stay was quite present  hotel staff were friendly and helpful. Cooling and nice weather; the mall is renovated with lots more shops and eateries  rather convenient. A little pity that the theme park is still under construction.           
ID-8725	 Check in process was quick and smooth  with friendly and welcoming Front Office personnel. We booked 2 rooms  and they were all good and clean. Excellent view from the hotel room where you will see the Awana Skyway cable cars in operation  and get excited        
ID-0006	 Check-in was done within a reasonable time. Deluxe room comes with a nice mountain view. Lots of fresh air and pretty good environment for a relax vacations. Service staff were quite courteous and helpful.             
ID-1117	 Decided to try this hotel out as a change to my usual preferred hotel  and was pleased with the overall stay. For those who are familiar with tourist hotel  all the hotels on top of  Highlands are interconnected.
ID-7768	 Entered the spacious and clean lobby  it was very a good way to start the start. However  staffs at reception were not welcoming. Theres a cafe and convenience store at the lobby.
ID-9890	 Have been going to tourist hotel once every few years and this time was quite disappointing. 
ID-7510	 Hotel is decent with amenities in place. Not even a single wifi spotted in the hotel room. We had to use it in the lobby or starbucks. Pretty disappointed we were still early for the opening of the extension of tourist hotel.
ID-6411	 I booked a deluxe room from Sydney for 3 nights paying $45 Australian dollars a night. When we went there - they asked us to do online check-in. We were offered a most filthy room. Room was so small with two single beds.
ID-6312	 I cant imagine that this hotel does not provide any wifi in room? They only have it at the lobby.. wow.. no wifi?? Hotel Staff at the front desk service was terrible! Unfriendly and not professional at all.
ID-1148	This hotel was very nice and acommodating. We arrived around 10pm without reservation and wanted a room. Not only did we get a suite for less than 100 dollars, the lady at the front desk allowed us to swim in the pool one hour later than closing. We thoroughly enjoyed ourselves in the indoor heated pool, and the room was very nice as well. We were within walking distance of local restaurants as well. The room was very clean and comfortable, and the staff was amazing.
ID-2846	The Sheraton Garden Grove Anaheim South Hotel is a newer built hotel on the Anaheim strip, but because it is newer, the location is very far away from Disneyland. Unlike the pictures, the hotel itself is rather small, with an tiny outdoor pool that is surrounded by the parking lot. The staff is present at best, and any questions or concerns are quickly passed on and not adequately resolved. I was under the impression that this Sheraton was the other hotel that was indeed closer to Disneyland, only to my dismay that this hotel is actually closer to an old liquor store and food stall. The rooms were really cramped and were not the cleanest for being such a newly built hotel.
ID-1040	The Grand Hyatt New York is conveniently located in Midtown Manhattan. This is an ideal for the business traveler, as they provide Wi-Fi, a 24-hour business center, and a spacious work area in the hotel rooms themselves. They also have ample meeting space and offer catering for meetings. Ample modern audio visual equipment is supplied so there is no need to bring any along. For those who have traveled to midtown for work, it is a very short jaunt to just about any midtown office building. Cabs are readily available in inclement weather or if you have a heavy load to carry. The hotel concierge can arrange car service as well. The hotel is very gracious about honoring special requests, such as early check-in, late check-out and high floors/quiet rooms and rooms away from the elevators. I have stayed in many business hotels in New York and the Grand Hyatt New York exceeds them all.
ID-1140	This hotel is a beautiful and historic landmark in beautiful downtown Richmond. It's outer beauty reflects it's inner beauty. High ceilings, art deco look, give this hotel the feel of Old Richmond in the modern day. The staff is courteous, polite, and on the ball about all questions and requests. Also, the rooms are sizeable, the beds are comfortable, and are just as beautiful as the lobby and outside. There is also a great restaurant/bar called Le Maire that incorporates classic southern foods with a modern style. Overall, the experience was amazing, and surprisingly the hotel is not overly expensive. A+.
ID-2926	Recently my fiancé and I stayed at the Oceana in Santa Barbara. The hotel room was small, over priced and offered precious few amenities. Most troubling, however was the decor and furnishing which were old and dated. My fiancé complained that the furniture was so old tha she was convinced it was dirty. She believes wicker furniture belongs outdoors and acts as a strong dust magnet. We will not return to this hotel.
