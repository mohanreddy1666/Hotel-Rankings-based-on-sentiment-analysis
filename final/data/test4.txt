ID-2838	I stayed here for two nights with a friend. First, I must mention that I live in the city, but this hotel was more convenient to where we wanted to go (the Pennsylvania Convention Center). But I would never stay here again, not even for that reason. Check in was supposed to be at 3. Our room wasn't ready until 5:30. Already a major strike against them, but whatever. Then our room smelled like smoke (and the entire hotel is supposed to be non-smoking). My friend has asthma, so that was a no-no. It was another hour to get another room. The view was nothing special, but we didn't really expect it to be. The next day, when we came back from the convention, it turned out that they hadn't even cleaned our room! There was NO reason for it to be dirty. We complained, and they didn't care. Horrible staff and very rude. We'll never stay here again!
ID-2866	This was by far one of the most overpriced Day's Inn hotels I've ever stayed in. The rooms are dark and dingy, and it has a very old smell to the whole place. The pool was tiny, so don't come here if you really look forward to a good swim! We stayed here for a few days during a move, and were very happy to leave when it was time.
ID-2858	There were many teens staying there. They stayed up all hours of the night partying. You couldn't enjoy sitting on your porch without some drunk coming up to you and pestering you.
ID-1186	What a beautiful resort! Landscaping is beautiful throughout, but especially by the wedding pavilion. While we were there, there were three different restaurants open. You had to made reservations for the Italian restaurant (dress code) and the Seafood restaurant, but the buffet was open during all hours. There was also a small grill by the pool that served American sandwiches. Food was good. The best part was the activity crew! They were fabulous! I highly recommend this as a great place to take the family!
ID-2904	Did not like the service that i was provided, when i entered the hotel. I also did not like the area, in which the hotel was located. Too much noise and events going on for me to feel relax and away from the city life.
ID-1218	La Quinta Inn and Suites chain offers the best stay for the money nationwide. The rooms are clean and favorably decorated and usually offer a refrigerator and a microwave standard. There is free wi-fi and satellite channels, as well. Most La Quintas offer a swimming pool and continental breakfast and welcome both kids and pets. The price for a stay is low end and the La Quinta Inns are generally located for easy access off the Highway. For restful, clean lodging at an affordable price, choose La Quinta Inn and Suites.
ID-2854	This place is horrible. The guest service pays you no attention. The other people staying there are trash, mainly prostitutes and junkies.
ID-2882	The Radisson Lackawanna Station Hotel, located in downtown Scranton, PA is perhaps one of the worst hotels I have ever had the opportunity to reside at. The hotel staff is rude, unknowledgable and inconsistent. The hotel room itself was dirty. There was a used bar of soap in the shower, a burnt out lightbulb in the nightstand lamp and multiple hairs in the sheets. The housecleaning staff have foul mouths and talk about racy, inappropriate subjects with guests around. I would highly recommend staying elsewhere if you are visiting Scranton, PA.
ID-1260	I recently spent 2 nights at Club Quarters in Philadelphia. Not only is it conveniently located to the historic sights, shopping and great options for meals, the staff were super friendly and the room was very comfortable. I was not sure how to use the computer to check-in, but someone came and guided me through. She even offered me a cup of coffee and some fresh warm cookies. One thing I really liked was the refillable and reusable water bottles that can be filled with filtered water. What a perfect thing to have for sight-seeing. After check out I had several hours before my bus was to depart, and they were very accommodating and stored my luggage for me. I will definitely return to Club Quarters.
ID-1220	Wow.   That is quite simply the first word that comes to mind when I think about the Cannery Pier Hotel. And the second. And even the third. My wife and I went to this hotel for our honeymoon, and spent an absolutely marvelous week here.   First and foremost, I have to say the staff here is simply incredible. Friendly, warm, and genuinely caring, they make you feel like you're visiting close friends or family rather than staying at a hotel.  Now, on to the hotel itself. We arrived early afternoon, a couple hours before check in time. The first surprise we had was that they had our room ready and allowed us to check in early. After a couple of hours on the road, this was very welcome indeed.   The room was absolutely beautiful. We stayed in the one bedroom suite, and the pictures simply do not do it justice. The wraparound deck provided a place to sit and watch the ships go by in the Columbia River (they even provided a complimentary set of binoculars!), or to just relax and watch the birds fly by. The jetted tub is big enough for two (and I'm a pretty tall guy) and was comfortable enough to never want to get out.  One of the treats at CPH is the wine hour. At 5:00, the staff puts out bagels, cream cheese, and lox, and then pours glasses of wine from different local vineyards for the guests. And again, this is complimentary!  If you want to go out for dinner, the staff will be happy to make reservations for you at any of a number of local restaurants, ranging from laid back pubs to upscale seafood restaurants. And when it's time to go to dinner, one of their staff will drive you to the restaurant in the hotel's 1939 Buick Towncar (I noticed from their website that they've added a 1938 Packard and a 1945 Caddilac). When you are done with dinner, the restaurant staff can simply call the hotel and the car will be by to pick you up. Again, this is a complimentary service. Just part of what makes CPH so special (we did give the driver a healthy tip every night we went out).   Finally, one of the things that actually has stuck with me since our honeymoon (and has us returning there every year for our anniversary, at least for one night) is this: About halfway through our stay there, my wife got sick. I went to the lobby, and asked the night clerk where the nearest drug store was. The next morning, when we came down for breakfast, the day clerk stopped us to ask how my wife was doing. The simple fact that they cared enough to make sure she was feeling better absolutely amazed us.  We look forward to spending many more anniversaries at this wonderful hotel.
ID-2852	This was an outrageously expensive hotel and the stay was awful. We had a suite that cost $1,400 a night. It started with a rude desk agent who behaved as if they were doing us a favor by checking us in. I asked a few questions about the room we had been assigned and was met with an attitude. When we went to the room we discovered that it was substantially smaller than the one we had last time even though it was a full $400 a night more. I wen back to check in to ask for another room and was told there were no others available. That first night we were bitten by fleas all night. In the morning when I complained they offered to switch us to another room but refused to do anything else like credit us for the first night's stay. They said that because the room we were being switched to was an upgrade that should more than make up for our inconvenience. I actually had to seek medical attention because of the bites. The hotel offered nothing to make up for our horrible stay and the manager never contacted me when I wrote a formal complaint. We had stayed there 3 times previously and were shocked at their lack of appreciation for repeat customers.
ID-1068	The La Quinta Inn in Brownsville, Texas was conveniently located right off highway 77. It was a fifteen minute drive to South Padre Island from the hotel which was a great trade off considering hotels on the island are at least three times as much a night. We had a large room with a king sized bed that included a microwave and a small fridge. The bathroom was large and bright with an extended curtain rod for the bathtub, which felt like a luxury. The maid came in everyday to fix the room and always left us new towels and soap. The desk clerk was informative and helpful.
ID-1176	The Seminole Hotel was awesome! Just the spirit and liveliness of the property was uplifting. My family and I entered through and we were greeted and asked if we needed help with our luggage. The hotel attendant was also very pleasant. She was very informative about the upcoming festivals and events. We decided to try the casinos and then later hit the room. The entire building was clean, spacious, bright, and easy to navigate. The employees politely directed us to the poker tables where my family spend well over $400. With our luck, we ended up losing everything. As we returned to the hotel, one of the staff members noticed our disappointment and brought us warm blankets to our room. This simple, but sweet gesture signified how pleasant the employees were. I would come back any day.
ID-2944	I stayed at the Holiday Inn in Rosslyn, and it was gross. My room smelled bad and was very dark. The wallpaper is peeling, the bathroom was dirty, and I had trouble sleeping because my bed was so uncomfortable. Elevators take forever, the place needs to be modernized, and the hotel staff is not particularly friendly.
ID-1048	I enjoyed my stay at the hilton hotel The room service the free wifi as well. The room waS very clean the people was very nice.
ID-1090	The Holiday Inn Express in Pueblo, CO was a great experience. The staff was friendly and accomadating. They served breakfast longer then usually due to the large amount of people at the hotel that weekend. The breakfast was free, delicious, and hot. The staff never allowed the food to run out. Also, it has a 24 hour gym, warm indoor pool, and a hot tub. The beds were like heaven. The pillows were amazing. I have never had that good of a nights rest in a hotel before. You will never be able to find a better staff thean the staff at the Holiday Inn Express.
ID-1198	Stayed in the hotel to visit family in the Eugene/Springfield area. Great location just off the I-5. The rooms were clean and the staff was very friendly. Our rate was really reasonable and it included a very nice breakfast. The breakfast had a lot of choices from eggs to pancakes, fruit and breakfast pastries. There was an indoor pool and it is pet friendly. The hotel was a pleasant surprise
