ID-8513	 I like this hotel very much compare to other hotels. This hotel has wider and bigger rooms than others. The staff of the hotel is very friendly and polite. This hotel is very value for money if there is a promotion available.
ID-0144	 i liked the hotel ambiance and the lightings in the room. the room temperature is nice as it wasnt so cold. had a pleasant stay and good night sleep. location wise its a little far since we need to go through so many escalators to...             
ID-1565	 I reserved the stay 10 days before arrival. Arrived at 5:30 pm  by that time my credit card was charged the whole stay already. I booked non smoking room  and I sent a reminder before arriving again. When checked in they gave 11 th floor.
ID-7186	 I went there to have a bit quiet  but was very noisy. One side the huge blower of AC the other side the road. Was a bit dirty. The staff is unfriendly! The food in the  Cafe is just not good.
ID-1786	 It was my second time in this hotel and definitely the last time. The hotel is below standards of 3 stars hotels and is disappointed to see this hotel getting same low standards as tourist Hotel. Toilet and rooms are smelly.
ID-1118	 Less crowded as compare to the other hotels in tourist hotel area as it is a bit hidden away. Large king size bed  reasonable spacious   with two resting chairs  writing table  TV  fridge  coffee making facility  rain shower bath room.   
ID-6519	 My friend and I had been staying at this hotel almost every month since last year. We like the hotel of the room space and the bed. Its is very comfortable. The only downside is the TV channels not so many to watch.
ID-9820	 Nice hotel. I think there is a lot of new reception staff. So basically they r not properly train to answer your questions. This hotel is ok and comfortable to sleep  enough space for kids to have fun in the room.
ID-5421	 Overall experience ok but in the morning around 7am i started to sweat while sleeping i think the Ac was off. Maybe because they thought the weather outside is so cold but in reality it is not.
ID-6272	 Paid wifi access for guest. Had a huge reception but only few - like 4 to 5 operating counter. Seems to be at least more than ten years old unfurnished structure of the view from cable car. Nice geography curves surrounding the hotel.
ID-4523	 Room was clean  bathroom was nice and contain transparent glass. No air cond but only fan. But it unexpected that we told by the staff after check out by phone calls around 3pm that the glass of the art has been broke after my stays.
ID-7248	 Spend one night at this hotel and the room was more spacious than the one at tourist hotel. The hotel is not new though but well maintained and clean. The hotel has a coffee bean and tea leaf cafe at the lobby and check
ID-2020	This hotel was infuriating the first night I arrived. I was scheduled for a reservation for two nights, and upon arriving with my confirmation number personally given by the sales manager of the hotel I was told that the reservation was only for one night. The entire hotel was booked and I was unable to get the room I had called ahead to make sure was still available. After this, I was pointed to another hotel to get a room there comped by the hampton inn. The problem was that they tried to make me pay once I arrived there as Hampton Inn listed me as a walk-in.
ID-2936	I stayed at the Ramada Hotel in Cordele, GA for three nights while I was visiting relatives. We tried two rooms before we found one that had working air conditioning and didn't smell of mold. The third night we were there, the air went out in the third room. We complained and received a full refund and will never return to this hotel ever again. The girl at the front desk didn't seem to care if we weren't happy at all.
ID-2798	My children and I stayed at this hotel in New Orleans in January, 2012. When we arrived at the hotel, we had to wait for over 15 minutes for someone to acknowledge us at the front desk. Once we finally got the key and made it to our room, the room was dirty. There was even a dirty town in the floor from the previous guest. I called the front desk to complain, however, no one showed up to clean until the next day. There is supposed to be a perk at this hotel where they have free hot snacks in the evening. They were anything but hot. It was basically room temp chicken nuggets and hot dogs. Find another hotel if you expect to have an enjoyable stay. This one was total disappointment.
ID-1050	I attended the Sea View hotel in New Jersey and I was totally blown away by how beautiful it was. My friend and I spent the weekend there for his brother's wedding and I felt so lucky! It was like a mini vacation being there. The beds were so soft and the pillows felt amazing, it was great to crash in bed after a long day. The views were fantastic and the hotel itself is just so stunning to look at. They did a really great job with the wedding and the staff was really nice aside from one ornery valet. They have an on sight restaurant that has fantastic food, I had a chicken wrap and it was really on point. Everything about this place was perfect! I really enjoyed my stay and I totally recommend it for everyone else!
ID-1250	The hotel was amazing! The rooms were so big and comfy. We brought our dog with us and the welcomed her that was a huge plus for us. We also forgot a playpen for our son so we called the front desk and they brought one right up! Everything was perfect.
