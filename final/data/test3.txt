ID-9025	 Stayed 1 night 3 rooms. This seems to be the most obvious affordable hotel up there. The rest of the hotels seems to be overpriced. Rooms were surprisingly quite huge and clean. Bed was good. No aircon but the big ceiling fan was more than enough.
ID-8286	 Stayed 2 nights with connecting rooms. Room is spacious. Toiletries are all provided. Theres also iron and hair dryer. Also a variety of tv channels. Downside is that there is no wifi in the rooms. Wifi is only located at lobby.             
ID-0027	 Stayed here during weekday so as to avoid the crowd. Fast check in. The room was cozy and much more spacious compared to others. Everything is well maintained. Just that free WIFI is not available.             
ID-6628	 The hotel is nice  for a night stay up on tourist hotel Highlands. We book this as its newly renovated. The room and bathroom is nice  clean. The services however is not 4 star. They dont help with luggage upon check in  during the stay theres...          
ID-8929	 The Q at the reception was long and the auto check in machine does not cater to personal request which I submitted when booking through online. I had requested for a non smoking room but the guy at the reception was very slow in allotment.
ID-5630	 The room is big with all the necessary amenities. It is walking distance to the tourist hotel main casino. Eateries are nearby. The staffs are friendly.   
ID-6310	 The rooms are good enough for the price and the staff was very helpful especially who gave us connecting rooms. There is no breakfast and gym here. Also no Aircon in the room. Wifi is available only in the lobby. 
ID-7632	 The rooms are ok try to book it online for good deals from their website. tourist hotel is more cheaper than this one... Yes the lobby of tourist hotel is very good. All hotels on tourist hotel are good. But if u on budget...             
ID-5633	 The rooms in the hotel are well furnished  clean and with comfortable beds. However  the rooms near the outside concert arena can be very loud at night.
ID-6734	 The staffs at tourist are really awesome! They are really friendly Have my two-day stay here and it is an awesome experience.          
ID-3135	 There are a few hotels at tourist hotel. Stayed at the Resort. Checked in was smooth. The hotel room was basic. There was a fan in the room and with open windows you get a nice cool air. Room was situated in a very noisy area.
ID-3360	 These old hotel still look good to stay. Comfort large bed and clean but furniture look so standard. Equiped with ceiling fan and flat tv  no aircon in room. Bathroom look clean with hot and cold shower.
ID-1086	We decided to have late evening cocktails and dessert at The Living room in the Peninsula, after a nice evening out. Service as always was excellent as is the ambience.
ID-1214	This hotel is very clean. Rooms were very nice in size. Cookies at the front desk just waiting for your enjoyment and pleasure. The hotel provides elevator service with luggage carts for your convience. They have a wonderful hot tub and pool to cool off after a hot day here. This hotel has a laundry facility as well. It is no wonder why people return here year after year. The service here is very warm and down to home. Comfort awaites you here in the country.
ID-2938	We stayed here on our way from Miami to Key West. We only had to spend a night, so we found first hotel that was available. The hotel is on the highway 1 so was the first (and only) one we tried. We paid about $60 for a room, which I thought was a bit too expensive for the hotel and neighborhood, but I was too tired to hunt for bargain.The hotel was rated as 2 stars. I have stayed at other two star hotels, and the rooms looked comparable at first sight. However, the first room that was given to us had a terrible smell of bleach. We couldn't stand there for a minute and went back to reception and got another room. No smell in other room. Once we settled and unpacked, I started noticing small problems. The refridgerator was too loud and at night I woke up and unplugged it. The bed was so fragile that everytime I turned in sleep, it squeeked & my wife woke up. The flush in bathroom was leaking. It flushed regularly every 5 minutes and made noice. The hair dryer was not working. The hot & cold indicators in the bathroom was interchanged. Above all, when I complained to the receptionist while checking out, she looked at me as if I was being too fuzzy. No wonder none of the problems were fixed yet. I would recommend everyone to stay away from this hotel.
ID-2892	NOT RECOMMENDED. The elevators are slow, the rooms are small and the staff is very rude. My wife called the front desk and asked for fresh towels to be brought up to our room. The clerk told her that he was busy but she could go downstairs and get them herself. She asked to speak with a manager and was told there wasn't one. Terrible customer service!
ID-2832	Me and my fiance recently stayed at the Trump Plaza. it was our first time to AC together and i must say it was a blast. They gave us some great Casino starters, getting 20 tier points get a free 25 dollars. Were not even big gamblers but said what the hell. We ended up winning 250 dollars in slots. It was a blast. Our hotel view was great, we stayed in one night, rented a movie, and order some room service. Even the food was great ( over priced, but all hotels are). Well worth it, Inexpensive and enjoyable
